## History

Meshes were taken from online resources (lost to time).
The Zeppelin textures were created by hand.

Terrain and cities were randomly generated as part of a common design requirement.
The terrain generation and city logic was implemented to support delivery of smaller deliverables (not included).

The concept was selected to work cohesively with the requirements of the project.

Engine was built by taking parts of [Neurosis](github.com/adamlwgriffiths/neurosis) and modifying it to use DirectX.
App base and Meshes were rendered using the included DirectX high-level utilities.
